                        There’s been a fair bit of hype surrounding the latest SpaceX upright rocket landing. Simple as
                        it seems, the excitementSci-Fi Today, Reality TV Tomorrow, at least for me, stems from how the
                        feat has brought us one step closer to fulfilling our sci-fi fantasies – etched into our minds
                        by the many blockbuster flicks Hollywood has produced.

                        Whether we realize it or not, spectacular scientific breakthroughs can be found in the very
                        heart of our homes. Let’s take TVs for example. Ask your grandparents whether they’d have
                        thought color TV was ever possible in the age of black & white screens. In retrospect, many may
                        not have expressed such optimism.
                        Then there were the early 2000s when industry pioneers sold us the idea of being able to spot
                        every blade of grass on the football pitch as the advent of high definition TV dawned upon us.
                        Industry naysayers expressed serious doubt as such a transition would have required a major
                        overhaul to equipment and broadcast standards.

                    <p>
                        Well, tell that today to any one of Thailand’s seven high definition (HD) digital television
                        channels. Yes, not one but seven. One of which is Amarin TV. It operates a satellite television
                        broadcasting channel, produces television content for free TV channels, and broadcasts
                        edu-tainment content through its Amarin Activ TV channel; all in HD.
                        There are two common issues that plague the delivery of HD content: space and speed. Have you
                        ever tried transferring gigabytes of information from your computer into an external hard drive?
                        If you have, you’ll understand “the wait”. Now imagine, HD content requires a broadcast station
                        to deliver gigabytes of content every few seconds just so you get that impeccable quality on
                        your TV screen.
                        Amarin TV needed a storage solution that would improve the speed of its post-production content
                        editing, deliver reliability, and scale rapidly without causing interruptions to service
                        operations. After implanting an EMC Isilon scale-out network-attached storage (NAS) platform,
                        Amarin improved operational efficiency by up to 10 times and reduced its production costs.
                        “To be competitive, Amarin TV needs high-performance technology. With the EMC Isilon X410, our
                        writing and reading speeds are 400 and 900 megabytes, respectively, per stream. This is
                        incredibly fast compared to current industry standards, and this helps set us apart from our
                        competitors,” says Cheewapat Nathalang, Chief Technical Officer at Amarin TV.
